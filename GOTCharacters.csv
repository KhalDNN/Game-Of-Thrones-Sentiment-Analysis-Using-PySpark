wouldn t even tell me her name i don t know if she s living or dead i don t know if she s a noblewoman or a fisherman s wife or a whore : i m the watcher on the wall : my father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts : with me lads castle black s not falling tonight : i m not asking you to forget your dead ill never forget mine i lost fifty brothers the night that mance attacked the wall but im asking you to think about your children now theyll never have children of their own if we dont band together the long night is coming and the dead come with it no clan can stop them the free folk cant stop them the nights watch cant stop them and all the southern kings cant stop them only together all of us and even then it may not be enough but at least we give the fuckers a fight : ramsay bolton cannot be allowed to keep winterfell my lady it is our duty to stop him even more so because he holds our brother rickon stark his prisoner : if i fall don t bring me back : go on tommy shear him good he s never met a girl he likes better than his own hair : let me give you some advice bastard never forget what you are the rest of the world will not wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you : seventeen years ago you rode off with robert baratheon you came back a year later with another woman s son : a bastard boy with nothing to inherit off to join the ancient order of the night s watch alongside his valiant brothers in arms : honor made you leave and honor brought you back : you re prettier than half my daughters : your death will be a gift for them south of the wall they ll never know what you ve done they ll never know how you died they won t even know your damn name but they ll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the wall gave his life for theirs : do you know i ve never been with any woman but cersei so in my own way i have more honor than poor old dead ned what was the name of that bastard son he fathered : brienne : no that wasn t it snow a bastard from the north now when when good old ned came home with some whore s baby did you pretend to love it no you re not very good at pretending you re an honest woman you hated that boy didn t you how could you not hate him the walking talking reminder that the honorable lord eddard stark fucked another woman : many years before that one of the boys came down with the pox maester luwin said if he made it through the night he d live but it would be a very long night so i sat with him all through the darkness listened to his ragged little breaths his coughing his whimpering : which boy : jon snow when my husband brought that baby home from the war i couldn t bear to look at him didn t want to see those brown stranger s eyes staring at me so i prayed to the gods take him away make him die he got the pox and i knew i was the worst woman who ever lived a murderer i d condemned this poor innocent child to a horrible death all because i was jealous of his mother a woman he didn t even know so i prayed to all seven gods let the boy live let him live and i ll love him i ll be a mother to him i ll beg my husband to give him a true name to call him stark and be done with it to make him one of us : and he lived : and he lived and i couldn t keep my promise and everything that s happened since then all this horror that s come to my family it s all because i couldn t love a motherless child : you think highly of this boy : lord commander of the night s watch : a bastard by some tavern slut : perhaps but that wasn t ned stark s way : bastards can rise high in the world like your half brother jon snow born the bastard of winterfell now the lord commander of the night s watch you didn t know yes he s done : well for himself : who does jon snow want to command the night s watch or the wildlings everyone knows he loved a wildling girl he spoke with mance rayder many times what would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if stannis s army hadn t come along we all saw him put the king beyond the wall out of his misery do you want to choose a man who s been fighting the wildlings all his life or a man who makes love to them : hes prettier then both my daughters but he knows how to fight hes young but he knows how to lead he didnt have to come to hardhome he came because he needs us and we need him : you have a good heart jon snow it will get us all killed : jon snow is a bastard not a stark : so was i father : your hold on the north will never be secure as long as a stark can walk through that door : we just have to make it to castle black once we re with jon ramsay won t be able to touch us : if you want to help him leave him be : they think you re some kind of god the man who returned from the dead : you are the son of the last true warden of the north northern families are loyal they ll fight for you if you ask a monster has taken our home and our brother we have to go back and save them both : the crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk as no other southerner would he died for us if we are not willing to do the same we re cowards if that s what we are we deserve to be the last of the free folk : why s your mother so deadset on us getting pretty for the king : it s for the queen i bet i heard she has a sleek little minge : i heard the prince is a right royal prick : next time i see you you ll be all in black : it was always my color : farewell snow : and you stark : there s great honor serving in the night s watch the starks have manned the wall for thousands of years and you are a stark you may not have my name but you have my blood : is my mother alive does she know about me where i am where i m going does she care : the next time we see each other we ll talk about your mother i promise : some of the night s watch fear you have too much affection for the wildings : they were born on the wrong side of the wall that doesn t make them monsters : i don t know what i have left to give you : you can give me the north : i can t even if wanted to i m a bastard a snow : kneel before me lay your sword at my feet pledge me your service and you ll rise again as jon stark lord of winterfell : your eyes are still brown is that still you in there : i think so hold off on burning my body for now : you shouldn t be alive it s not right : neither was killing me : winterfell is our home it s ours and arya s and bran s and rickon s wherever they are it belongs to our family we have to fight for it : i am tired of fighting it s all i ve done since i left home i killed brothers of the night s watch i ve killed wildlings i ve killed men i admire i hanged a boy younger than bran i ve fought and i lost : if we don t take back the north we ll never be safe i want you to help me but i ll do it myself if i have to : come bastard you don t have the men you don t have the horses and you don t have winterfell why lead those poor souls into slaughter there s no need for a battle get off your horse and kneel i m a man of mercy : you re right there s no need for a battle thousands of men don t need to die only one of us let s end this the old way you against me : chuckles i keep hearing stories about you bastard the way people in the north talk about you you re the greatest swordsman who ever walked maybe you are that good maybe not i don t know if i d beat you but i know that my army will beat yours i have 6 000 men you have what half that not even : aye you have the numbers will your men want to fight for you when

lannister,lena headey : nell williams,cersei i lannister,cersei,when you play the game of thrones you win or you die there is no middle ground : someday you ll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it : everyone who isn t us is an enemy : you re just a soldier aren t you you take your orders and you carry on i suppose it makes sense your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow : i was also trained to kill my enemies your grace : as was i : targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure jaime and i are more than brother sister came into this world together we belong together : you want to be hand of the king you want to rule this is what ruling is lying on a bed of weeds ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep : one day i pray you love someone i pray you love her so much when you close your eyes you see her face i want that for you i want you to know what it s like to love someone truly love someone before i take her from you : sometimes i wonder if this is the price for what we ve done for our sins : the gods have no mercy that s why they re gods : tears aren t a woman s only weapon the best one s between your legs : if i wanted to kill to you do you think i d let a wooden door stop me : if you ever call me sister again i ll have you strangled in your sleep : nobody cares what your father once told you : even joffrey he was all i had once before myrcella was born i used to spend hours looking at him his wisps of hair his tiny little hands and feet he was such a jolly little fellow you always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies we should have known even then we should have known its nonsense whenever he was with me he was happy and no one can take that away from me not even joffrey : loyalty can be such a hard thing to define this city alone is filled with all sorts of ambitious opportunists looking to reinvent themselves pretending to be something they re not who knows what lurks within their hearts you are a girl from the north here in service to lady margaery one can only assume her interests are yours yet loyalty to a king : must be absolute beyond question and if your loyalties were to become conflicted between your king and the very people whom you serve what do you do then : what good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love : joffrey is dead myrcella s been sold like livestock and now you want to ship me off to highgarden and steal my boy my last boy margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you ll fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart i will burn our house to the ground before i let that happen : look at me look at my face it s the last thing you ll see before you die : i will not kneel before some bare footed commoner and beg his forgiveness : order your man to step aside or there ll be violence : i choose violence : i do things because they feel good i drink because it feels good i killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him i fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me i lie about fucking my brother because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites i killed your high sparrow and all his little sparrows all his septons all his septas all his filthy soldiers because it felt good to watch them burn it felt good to imagine their shock and their pain no thought has ever given me greater joy : cersei i want her i ll sail with your fleet all 30 of my ships and if we don t drown at the bottom of blackwater bay i ll fuck this blond queen and i ll fuck her well : this war isn t about : we re not attacking king s landing so that you can rape the queen : i m not going to : her i m going to : her : as if she would just let you : i don t distrust you because you re a woman i distrust you because you re not as smart as you think you are : my sister and i have our differences she takes great pleasure in her little charades i take great pleasure in thwarting them : you re a hateful woman why have the gods made me love a hateful woman : lies come easily to you everyone knows that but innocence decency concern you re not very good at those i m afraid perhaps that s why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me : i wonder if you re the worst person i ve ever met at a certain age it s hard to recall but the truly vile do stand out through the years do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells i do i ll never forget it : i now

need trust to have a truce : i trust you : there it is there s the look i ve seen it for 17 years on face after face you all despise me kingslayer oathbreaker a man without honor : he loved to watch people burn the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones he burned lords he didn t like he burned hands who disobeyed him he burned anyone who was against him before long half the country was against him : once again i came to the king begging him to surrender he told me to bring him my father s head then he turned to his pyromancer burn them all he said burn them in their homes burn them in their beds tell me if your precious renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men women and children burned alive would you have done it would you have kept your oath then first i killed the pyromancer and then when the king turned to flee i drove my sword into his back burn them all he kept saying burn them all i don t think he expected to die he he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash i slit his throat to make sure that didn t happen that s where ned stark found me : if this is true why didn t you tell anyone why didn t you tell lord stark : stark you think the honorable ned stark wanted to hear my side he judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me by what right does the wolf judge the lion by what right : tell robb stark i m sorry i couldn t make his uncle s wedding the lannisters send their regards : i murdered people so i could be here with you : you re a hateful woman why have the gods condemned me to love a hateful woman : do you know the last order the mad king gave me to bring him your head i saved your life so you can murder my brother : there s no kind of killing that doesn t have its own word : cousins : he murdered my father if i ever see him i ll split him in two then i ll give him your regards : we don t choose whom we love : we re the only ones who matter and everything they ve taken from us we re going to take back and more : what did you do to him exactly i haven t been able to get a clear answer : oh a number of things : does he understand what we re saying i mean to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place : he understands well enough : so tell him to march into the sept and crush the high sparrow s head like a melon : you re blessed with abilities that few men possess you re blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the kingdoms and you re still blessed with youth and what have you done with these blessings huh you ve served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings one a madman the other a drunk : we have our differences jaime and i he s braver i m better looking : you think

for being a dwarf : oh yes i am i ve been on trial for that my entire life : tyrion lannister is one of the few people alive who can make this country a better place he has the mind for it he has the will and he has the right last name : let me give you some advice bastard never forget what you are the rest of the world will not wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you : what the hell do you know about being a bastard : all dwarfs are bastards in their fathers eyes : i still can t believe you re going it s ridiculous even for you : where s your sense of wonder the greatest structure ever built the intrepid men of the night s watch the wintry abode of white walkers : tell me you re not thinking of taking the black : and go celibate the whores would be begging from dorne to casterly rock no i just want to stand on top of the wall and piss off the edge of the world : even if the boy lives he d be a cripple grotesque give me a good clean death anyway : speaking for the grotesques i d have to disagree death is so final whereas life ah life is full of possibilities i hope the boy does wake i d be very interested to hear what he has to say : my dear brother at times you make me wonder whose side you re on : my dear brother you wound me you know how much i love my family : everything s better with some wine in the belly : yes until my brother killed him life is full of these little ironies my sister married the new king and my repulsive nephew will be king after him i must do my part for the honor of my house wouldn t you agree but how well my brother has his sword and i have my mind and a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone that s why i read so much jon snow : is this some kind of trick why do you want to help him : i have a tender spot in my heart for cripples bastards and broken things : when i was ten i stuffed my uncle s boots with goat shit when confronted with my crime i blamed a squire poor boy was flogged and i escaped justice when i was twelve i milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew i flogged the one eyed snake i skinned my sausage i made the bald man cry into the turtle stew which i do believe my sister ate at least i hope she did i once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel : i am tyrion son of tywin of clan lannister : how would you like to die tyrion son of tywin : in my own bed at the age of 80 with a belly full of wine and a girl s mouth around my cock : we have our differences jaime and i he s braver i m better looking : if i were capable of tricking father i d be emperor of the world by now : you might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead : i am not ned stark i understand the way this game is played threaten me again and i will have you thrown into the sea : are you drunk i ll not have my honor questioned by an imp : i m not questioning your honor lord janos i m denying it s existence : if you think i ll stand here and take this from you dwarf : dwarf mm you

re talking to a king :  : and now i ve struck a king did my hand fall from my wrist : the lord of light wants his enemies burned the drowned god wants them drowned why are all the gods such vicious cunts where is the god of tits and wine : i will hurt you for this a day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid : get out : i would kill for you do you know that i expect i ll have to before this is over you re mine : you re an intelligent man i like to think : an intelligent man : oh no one disputes that not even the multitudes that despise you : i wish we could converse as two : intelligent men : i wish we could too : i chopped wood once no i watched my brother chopping wood : these bad people are what i m good at out talking them out thinking them it s what i am and i like it i like it more than anything i ve ever done : you re a clever man but you re not half as clever as you think you are : still makes me more clever than you : it s hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of the arrangement probably sansa though loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery : what did you once call me a drunken little lust filled beast : almost laughing more than once : there you have it nothing to worry about drinking and lust no man can match me in these things i am the god of tits and wine i shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel i visit : losing his temper you can drink you can joke you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable but you will do your duty : then you ll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock : she is no longer yours to torment : everyone is mine to torment you d do well to remember that you little monster : oh i m a monster perhaps you should speak to me more softly then monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies : you just sent the most powerful man in westeros to bed without his supper : you re a fool if you think he s the most powerful man in westeros : a treasonous statement joffrey is the king : do you really think a crown gives you power : no i think armies give you power robb stark had an army and you defeated him all the same : the northerners will never forget : good let them remember what will happen if they decide to march on the south : do you think she ll open her legs for me when i tell her how we murdered her mother and brother : one way or another you will get that girl pregnant : i will not rape her : king s landing can be a nest of vipers to the uninitiated : i lie awake all night staring at the canopy thinking of how they died : i could get essence of nightshade to help you sleep : do you know what they did to my brother how they sewed his direwolf s head onto his body and my mother they say they cut her throat to the bone and threw her body in the river : what happened to your family was a terrible crime i didn t know your brother he seemed like a good man but i didn t know him your mother on the other hand i admired her she wanted to have me executed but i admired her she was a strong woman and she was fierce when it came to protecting her children sansa your mother would want you to carry on you know it s true : i saved you i saved this city and all your worthless lives i should have let stannis kill you all : i did not do it i did not kill joffrey but i wish that i had watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than a thousand lying whores i wish i was the monster you think i am i wish i had enough poison for the whole pack of you i would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it : ser meryn ser meryn escort the prisoner back to his cell : i will not give my life for joffrey s murder and i know i ll get no justice here so i will let the gods decide my fate i demand a trial by combat : i made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer : i m sorry what am i grateful for the opportunity to live and die at the wall as punishment for a crime i did not commit : you threw your life away you threw it away it s not a joke you understand that don t you : of course it s a joke just not a very funny one : that deal you made it was everything father wanted you do see that he gets you back as his heir the future lord of the rock and he ships me off to castle black out of sight at last all so perfect it felt good to take that from him he knows i m innocent and he s willing to sacrifice me anyway : he s willing to sacrifice any of us : not you you re the golden son you could kill a king lose a hand fuck your own sister you ll always be the golden son : careful i m the last friend you ve got : what s the punishment for regicide drawing and quartering hanging breaking at the wheel : beheading : seems rather ordinary and he was my nephew as well so what s that fratricide is brothers filicide is sons nepoticide that s the one matricide patricide infanticide suicide there s no kind of killing that doesn t have its own word : cousins : cousins you re right there is no word for cousin killing well done : you shot me you re no son of mine : i am your son i have always been your son : the future is shit just like the past : if you are tyrion lannister why shouldn t i kill you to pay your family back for what it did to mine : you want revenge against the lannisters i killed my mother joanna lannister on the day i was born i killed my father tywin lannister with a bolt to the heart i am the greatest lannister killer of our time : so i should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family : into your service your grace we have only just met it s too soon to know if you deserve my service : house targaryen is gone not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you the starks are gone as well our two terrible fathers saw to that the remaining members of house lannister will never back you not ever stannis baratheon won t back you either his entire claim to the throne rests on the illegitimacy of yours that leaves the tyrells not impossible but not enough : so mainly you talk : and drink i ve survived so far : that s what i do i drink and i know things : i m here to help please don t eat the help : a wise man once said that the true history of the world is the history of great conversations in elegant rooms : who said this : me just now : let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it : are you afraid you should be you re in the great game now and the great game s terrifying : for what its worth ive been a cynic for as long as i can remember everyones always asking me to believe in things family gods kings myself it was often tempting until i saw where belief got people so i said no thank you to belief yet here i am i believe in you : we ll need plenty of candles for lord tyrion s chamber i m told he reads all night : i m told he : all night : but how much could he possibly drink a man of his stature : we ve brought our eight barrels of ale from the cellar perhaps we ll find out : what s a dwarf like down below i ve always wondered : mmm might surprise you : mmm : he s good with his fingers too and his tongue : i didn t realize you placed such a high value on my brother s life : he s a lannister he might be the lowest of the lannisters but he s one of us and every day that he remains a prisoner the less our names commands respect : the whole way from dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to tywin lannister a head twice the size of his body a tail between his legs claws one red eye the privates of both a girl and a boy when we met your sister she promised she would show you to us every day we would ask every day she would say soon then she and your brother took us to your nursery and she unveiled the freak your head was a bit large your arms and legs were a bit small but no claw no red eye no tail between your legs just a tiny pink cock we didn t try to hide our disappointment thats not a monster i told cersei thats just a baby : he murdered my father if i ever see him i ll split him in two : i ll give him your regards : the dwarf told you to do this : no one tells me to do anything : clever fellow can t argue with his
